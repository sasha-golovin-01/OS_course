Physical address is a real adress of data slot that exists in reality, inbphysical memory, while virtual address is a pointer to memory space which OS allows to process to work.

Virtual memory capacity is usually larger in comparison with the hardware memory, because VA is mapped to the PAs dynamically in RAM.
